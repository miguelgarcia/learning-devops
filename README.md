# While Learning DevOps

This repository has projects and snippets related to DevOps I've created while taking courses and learning.

## Projects:

- `k8s-aws-cluster`: Scripts to create (and then delete) a Kubernetes cluster on AWS.
- `wordpress-k8s-aws`: Scripts to deploy WordPress on a Kubernetes cluster on AWS using replication and volumes. A script to delete resources is also provided.
- `wordpress-docker-compose`: docker-compose file to start WordPress with a MySQL database.
